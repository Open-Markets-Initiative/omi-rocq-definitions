    Generated from the binary model. Every record is a run of fields, and carries the two
    theorems the model's rules call for: an encoding is as wide as its fields say, and
    decoding what was encoded gives the record back and leaves the bytes after it alone.

    A field is a number of its width, a run of bytes kept as they are, or a record nested
    in it. A number's width bounds it, which the record's own bound predicate states, and
    the round trip asks for that predicate - a field is an N, so the bound is not in the
    type. Text and reserved runs are kept byte for byte, so what is decoded encodes back
    unchanged.

    Each record is a module of its own, so two messages may both have a price and a
    consumer may read either.

    What this definition does not state, and the model does:
      - a length prefix framing what follows
